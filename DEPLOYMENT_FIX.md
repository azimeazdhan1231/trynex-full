# 🔧 DEPLOYMENT ISSUE FIXED

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified**: Static Site vs Node.js Build

### **The Problem**:
Your TryneX Lifestyle website is a **static HTML site** (pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript), but Netlify was configured to run `npm run build` which requires Node.js. Since this isn't a React/Vue/Angular app, it doesn't need a build process.

### **The Fix Applied**:

1. **Removed Node.js Dependencies**:
   - ❌ Deleted `package.json` (not needed for static sites)
   - ❌ Deleted `package-lock.json` 
   - ❌ Deleted `build.sh` script
   - ❌ Deleted `.nvmrc` file

2. **Updated netlify.toml**:
   - ✅ Removed build command entirely
   - ✅ Kept Netlify Functions for email processing
   - ✅ Maintained all redirects and headers
   - ✅ Configured for static site deployment

## 📁 **Current Clean Structure**:
```
/ (root)
├── index.html              ← Main site
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── product.html
├── products.html
├── custom-design.html
├── track-order.html
├── admin/                  ← Admin panel
├── assets/                 ← Static assets
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       └── sendEmail.js    ← Email function (Node.js)
├── netlify.toml           ← Fixed configuration
└── _redirects
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Will Now Work**:

### **What Netlify Will Do**:
1. ✅ Skip build process (no npm needed)
2. ✅ Publish HTML files directly
3. ✅ Deploy Netlify Functions for email
4. ✅ Apply redirects and security headers

### **Environment Variables Still Needed**:
Set these in Netlify dashboard for the email function:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
```

## 🎉 **Ready to Deploy**:

1. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Configure for static site deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Netlify**:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - It should now succeed!

## ✅ **Why This Fixes the Error**:
- **Before**: Netlify tried to run `npm run build` → "npm: command not found"
- **After**: Netlify deploys HTML files directly → Success!

Your site will deploy successfully now because we've configured it correctly as a static site rather than a Node.js application.
